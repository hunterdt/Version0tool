            "text": "What is it? Salesforce Engage allows the Sales team to create micro email campaigns using content curated by Marketing. Sales users can create 1:1 or 1:many email campaigns within Salesforce.  Why should I use it? Engage is replacing the Send Pardot Email button in Salesforce. Engage also provides insight into micro campaigns that are actionable, allowing individual Sales users to take action on positive email results without needing to contact Marketing. Finally, Engage emails provide consistent messaging and branding across all email communication.  How do I create a campaign? 1. Log in to Salesforce and select the Leads tab. 2. Select the lead(s) you would like to email: 1:1 Campaign: If you are sending the email to one contact, simply click on the lead name. 1:many Campaign: If you are sending an email to multiple contacts, A.

Review the names in the email before sending. Personalize it if it reads, Hello PURCHASER.   Engage limits email sends to 200 emails per rep every 24 hours.         How do I request a new Engage email template? To request a new Engage email template, content must first be approved during the bi-weekly Sales and Marketing Collateral Meeting. The meeting is held in Apollo 03.104 every other Thursday at 1:00pm.   All requests should be made by Sales Leadership for the teams that they manage.   While not required, creating a SIM is HIGHLY recommended prior to the meeting for prioritization. Make sure to CC Jeff Spicer (jefspi@) on the request so that he is aware and can follow the progress of email approval.   How do I monitor the success of my Engage Campaigns? Engage provides interactive, real-time reports on the success of your Engage campaigns. In the Engage Reports, you can view opens, clicks, and click-through rate (CTR).  To access the reports: 1.
